# ☀️ Residential Solar Panel Decision Analysis

This project investigates whether a homeowner should install residential solar panels using structured decision-making methods. 

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Decision Tree Modeling**: Compare install vs. don’t install under various conditions.
- **Influence Diagram**: Visualize causal relationships across uncertainties and decisions.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Assess how key inputs (e.g., grid rate, degradation) impact ROI.
- **Scenario Evaluation**: Model financial outcomes across payment and utility cases.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- **Decision Modeling**: Evaluate solar panel decisions using decision trees and influence diagrams.
- **Financial Evaluation**: Calculate 30-year net benefits under multiple payment and usage scenarios.
- **Risk & Uncertainty**: Incorporate solar efficiency, maintenance, and energy price uncertainty.
- **Policy Impact**: Consider how participation in virtual power plants (VPPs) or net metering affects savings.

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques

- Excel (Decision Trees, Sensitivity Analysis)
- Influence Diagram (PowerPoint/Excel)
- Scenario Modeling with real & simulated data
- Structured Decision Making (Value-focused thinking)

## 📈 Key Highlights

- **Best Scenario**: Full upfront installation yields highest long-term savings across most cases.
- **Break-even Point**: Installation breaks even by ~year 9 in high-usage households.
- **Sensitivity Insight**: Utility rate growth and energy usage have strongest influence on decision.
- **VPP Impact**: Participation improves outcomes significantly by enabling energy sales back to grid.

## 💡 Recommendation

Installing solar panels—especially with upfront payment—is financially beneficial in the long run, assuming moderate-to-high energy use and rising utility costs. Sensitivity analysis confirms decision robustness even under adverse conditions like high maintenance or panel degradation.
